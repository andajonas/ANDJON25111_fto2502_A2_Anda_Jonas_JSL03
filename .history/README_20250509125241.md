# 🗂️ Console-Based Kanban Board

This project is a **JavaScript-powered Kanban board** that runs in the browser console. It allows users to manage tasks with structured data, add new tasks through prompts, and view completed tasks — all without a visual UI.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Tasks stored as objects in an array for clean, structured data
- ➕ Add up to **3 new tasks** to avoid overloading the board
- 🆔 Auto-generates a **unique incremental ID** for each new task
- 📝 Prompts user for title, description, and status (todo, doing, done)
- 🚫 Alerts when the task limit is reached with a custom message: "There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console"
- 📋 Logs:
  - All tasks with a label (`=== All Tasks ===`)
  - Completed tasks with a label (`=== Completed Tasks ===`)
- 🔍 Filter function returns tasks with `status: "done"`
- 🧠 Clear, well-commented code with meaningful function and variable names
- 🔁 Automatically prompts to add a task on page load

## 🧪 Developer Notes

- You can manually test features by calling these functions in the console:
  ```js
  addTask();             // Adds a new task via prompt
  logAllTasks();         // Logs all tasks
  logCompletedTasks();   // Logs only done tasks
  filterDoneTasks();     // Returns an array of done tasks
